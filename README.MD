# AI Task Management Agent

This project demonstrates how AI agents can integrate with task management tools to automate workflows seamlessly. The application uses Cohere's LLM to process user inputs, interact with Asana, and perform actions like creating tasks with due datesâ€”all through a conversational interface.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mekazstan/task-create-agent.git
cd task-create-agent
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up environment variables:
    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
    ```bash
        cp ../.env.example ../.env
    ```
    - Fill in your Cohere API key, Asana API key, and other configurations.

5. Run the backend server:
    ```bash
        uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend server will start on http://127.0.0.1:8000.

### . Set Up the Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
    ```bash
        cd ../frontend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

        npm install
    ```
3. Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
        npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will start on http://127.0.0.1:5173

### Usage
1. Open the frontend in your browser.
2. Interact with the AI assistant by providing task-related inputs.
